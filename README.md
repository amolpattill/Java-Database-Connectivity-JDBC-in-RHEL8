# Java-Database-Connectivity-JDBC-in-RHEL8
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application program interface (API) packaged with the Java SE edition that makes it possible to standardize and simplify the process of connecting Java applications to external, relational database management systems (RDBMS).   Fundamentally, applications written in Java perform logic. The Java language provides facilities for performing iterative logic with looks, conditional logic with if statements and object-oriented analysis through the use of classes and interfaces. But Java applications do not store data persistently. Data persistence is typically delegated to NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra, or to relational databases such as IBM’s DB2 or Microsoft’s SQL Server or the popular open source database MySQL.  JDBC interfaces, classes and components The JDBC API is composed of a number of interfaces and classes that represent a connection to the database, provide facilities for sending SQL queries to a database and help Java developer process the results of relational database interactions..
